## Babel chat

A JavaScript-based solo project to construct an online chatroom with in-built language translation. Work in progress.

Current and future functionality are outlined on the [Trello board.](https://trello.com/b/9kL2vvjJ/babel-chat)

```
As a user
So that I can chat to someone easily
I want to see new messages without refreshing the page

As a user
So that I can understand who I'm chatting with
I want to able to receive messages translated into my language

As a user
To make my experience smoother
I want the program to automatically detect what language I'm typing in

As a user
To enhance my experience
I want an elegant, practical design
```
